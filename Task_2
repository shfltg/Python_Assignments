#1. Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “c” as a string
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd Python Training” as a string.


n = int(input("Enter an input "))
if n % 5 == 0 and n % 3 == 0:
    print("Consultadd Python Training")
elif n % 5 == 0:
    print("c")
elif n % 3 == 0:
    print("Consultadd")
else:
   pass
   
#4. Write a program in Python to break and continue if the following cases occurs:
● If user enters a negative number just break the loop and print “It’s Over”
● If user enters a positive number just continue in the loop and print “Good Going”"""



    number = int(input("Enter a number "))
    if number < 0:
        print("It's over")
        break
    elif number >0:
        print("Good Going")
        continue


#5. Write a program in Python which will find all such numbers which 
are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200.


lower=2000
upper= 3200
for i in range(lower,upper+1):
    if i % 7 ==0 and i % 5 !=0:
        print(i)



#6. What is the output of the following code examples?
(a) x=123 
for i in x:
    print(i)"""

output: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

(b)
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
else:
    print(“error”)
output :print(“error”)
SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier

(c)
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        Break
output :Break
NameError: name 'Break' is not defined


#7. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
#Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5
#Note: Use ‘continue’ statement'''
for x in range(0,7):
    if (x==3) or (x==6):
        continue
    else:
        print(x)
