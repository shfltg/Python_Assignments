#1. Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “c” as a string
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd Python Training” as a string.


n = int(input("Enter an input "))
if n % 5 == 0 and n % 3 == 0:
    print("Consultadd Python Training")
elif n % 5 == 0:
    print("c")
elif n % 3 == 0:
    print("Consultadd")
else:
   pass
   
#4. Write a program in Python to break and continue if the following cases occurs:
● If user enters a negative number just break the loop and print “It’s Over”
● If user enters a positive number just continue in the loop and print “Good Going”"""


while True:
    n = int(input("Enter a number "))
    if n < 0:
        print("It's over")
        break
    elif nr >0:
        print("Good Going")
        continue


#5. Write a program in Python which will find all such numbers which 
are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200.


lower=2000
upper= 3200
for i in range(lower,upper+1):
    if i % 7 ==0 and i % 5 !=0:
        print(i)



#6. What is the output of the following code examples?
(a) x=123 
for i in x:
    print(i)"""

output: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

(b)
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
else:
    print(“error”)
output :print(“error”)
SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier

(c)
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        Break
output :Break
NameError: name 'Break' is not defined


#7. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
#Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5
#Note: Use ‘continue’ statement'''
for x in range(0,7):
    if (x==3) or (x==6):
        continue
    else:
        print(x)
        
#8. Write a program that accepts a string as an input from the user and calculate the number of digits
and letters.
#Sample input: consul72
#Expected output: Letters 6 Digits 2

s=input("Enter data: ")
count_1=0
count_2=0
for x in s:
    if x.isalpha():
        count_1=count_1+1
    elif x.isdigit():
        count_2=count_2+1
    else:
        pass
print("Letters: "count_1)
print("Digits: "count_2)

#9. (a)Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”.
If the correct number is guessed the program stops, otherwise it continues forever.

while True:
    n = int(input("guess the lucky number: "))
    if (n==7):
        break
    else:
        continue

(b)Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time.
Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and ‘answer’ for the answer to the question
whether they want to continue guessing.
The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or answers “no”.
( The program continues as long as a user has not answered “no” and has not guessed
the correct number)  

#10. Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number. Use a while loop and a counter, such as 
  Counter=1
 While counter <= 5:
print(“Type in the”, counter, “number”)
 counter=counter+1 
The program asks for five guesses (no matter whether the correct number was guessed or not). 
If the correct number is guessed, the program outputs “Good guess!”, otherwise it outputs “Try again!”. After the fifth guess it stops and prints “Game over!”

counter=1
answer=5
while (counter <= 5):
    print(“type in the”,counter,“number”)
    number=int(input"Guess number: ")
    if number==answer:
        print("Good guess")
    elif counter<5:
        print("Try again")
    counter=counter+1
if counter>5:
    print("game over")
    
#11. In the previous question, insert break after the “Good guess!” print statement. 
break will terminate the while loop so that users do not have to continue guessing after 
they found the number. If the user does not guess the number at all, 
print “Sorry but that was not very successful”."""
    
counter=1
answer=5
while (counter <= 5):
    print(“type in the”,counter,“number”)
    number=int(input"Guess number: ")
    if number==answer:
        print("Good guess")
        break
    else:
        print("Sorry but that was not very successful")
    counter=counter+1
