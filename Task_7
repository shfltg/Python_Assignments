2. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which
takes length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape
where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.
class Shape:
        def __init__(self):
                print("This is just a shape")
        def area(self):
                print("Area of shape")

class Square(Shape):
        def __init__(self,length):
                self.length=length
        def area(self):
                print("Area of square:",self.length*self.length)

s=Square(5)
s.area()
