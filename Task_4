#1.Write a program to reverse a string.
Sample input: “1234abcd”
Expected output: “dcba4321”
s= '1234abcd'
r=s[-1::-1]
print(r)

#2. Write a function that accepts a string and prints the number of uppercase letters and lowercase
letters.
Sample input: “abcSdefPghijQkl”
Expected Output: No. of Uppercase characters : 3 No. of Lower case Characters : 12

3. Create a function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.'''
def fun(l):
    new_list=[]
    for x in l:
        if x not in new_list:
            new_list.append(x)
    return (new_list)
print(fun(['a','a','b','b','c','c','d','e']))
#print(new_list())

'''4. Write a program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words
in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

#5. Write a program that accepts a sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all
characters in the sentence capitalized.
Sample input: Hello world Practice makes man perfect
Expected output: HELLO WORLD PRACTICE MAKES MAN PERFECT

s="Hello world Practice makes man perfect"
r=s.upper()
print(r)

#6. Define a function that can receive two integral numbers in string form and compute their sum and
print it in the console.'''

def sum(a,b):
    c=int(a)+int(b)
    return c
s=(sum('2','5')) or print(sum('2','5'))
print("sum:",s)

#7. Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with the maximum length
in the console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print both the strings line
by line.

def fun_string(s1,s2):
    if len(s1)>len(s2):
        print(s1)
    elif len(s2)>len(s1):
        print(s2)
    elif len(s1)==len(s2):
        print(s1)
        print(s2)

input1 = input("Enter first string: ")
input2 = input("Enter second string: ")

fun_string(input1,input2)

#8. Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where the values are square of numbers
between 1 and 20 (both 1 and 20 included).

def tup():
    new_tup=[]
    for x in range(1,21):
        x=x*x
        new_tup.append(x)
    return tuple(new_tup)
#t=tuple(new_tup)
print(tup())


#9. Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print all the
numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers.
Sample input: show Numbers(3) (where limit=3)
Expected output:
0 EVEN
1 ODD
2 EVEN
3 ODD'''

def showNumbers(limit):
    for x in range(0,limit+1):
        if x%2==0:
            print(x,"EVEN")
        else:
            print(x,"ODD")
showNumbers(4)
