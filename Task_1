#1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
 #them belongs to a different data type.
a=2 ;b=3.5; c="Google"
print("a =",a)
print("b=",b)
print("c =",c)

#2. Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.

a=1+3j
b=2
c=a
a=b
b=c
print("a =",a)
print("b=",b)

#3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
#with third variable

a = 1 + 3j
b = 2
c = a
a = b
b = c
print("a =", a)
print("b=", b)

#Without third variable
a="Google"
b=2
a,b=b,a
print("a =",a)
print("b=",b)

#4. Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
#Python 3.x
a=input("Enter value :")
print(a)
#Python 2.x
a=raw_input("Enter value :")
print(a)

#6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc

#Python 3.x
a=input("Enter value :")
print(a)
#Python 2.x
a=raw_input("Enter value :")
print(a)

#5. Write a program to complete the task given below:Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in
#another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the final output.

x= int(input("Enter a number between 1-20: "))
y= int(input("Enter a number between 1-20: "))
z=x+y
result=int(z)+30
print("result= ",result)

#6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc
a="Google"
print("The data type of the input value is : " , type(a))

#7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and UPPERCASE.
#(Refer: https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/)
input = python training
lowerCamel:
pythonTraining
UpperCamel:
PythonTraining
snake_case:
python_training
UPPERCASE:
PYTHON TRAINING

#8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
a=4
a=5
print(a)
Ouput : 5 because variable always takes last entered value. It will change the value because the variable ‘a’ is assigned a 
different memory location everytime we change the values.
